# Best Practices

### 1. Start with a Storybook Scenario

Create a Storybook story that mirrors your test scenario. This helps visualize the component state and behavior, and can serve as a basis for further testing integrations as Storybookâ€™s testing capabilities evolve.

### 2. Test Values, Not HTML Markup

Focus on testing the plain values or states rather than the underlying HTML or formatting details.

### 3. Avoid Direct React Testing Library Calls

Although Atomic Testing Library leverages React Testing Library (RTL), direct RTL calls should be avoided. This maintains the abstraction and predictability of your tests, similar to avoiding direct DOM manipulation in React components.

### 4. Use `data-testid` for Key Elements

Use `data-testid` attributes to mark key components. This allows you to easily locate and interact with these elements in your tests.
