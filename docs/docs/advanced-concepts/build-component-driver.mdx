# Build Component Driver

Component drivers encapsulate the logic for interacting with a UI component. While many drivers are provided out of the box, you can build your own for custom widgets.

## Basic structure

A driver extends `ComponentDriver` and implements any interfaces that describe its capabilities. The `constructor` receives a locator, an interactor and optional configuration.

```ts title="SimpleButtonDriver.ts"
import { ComponentDriver, IClickableDriver } from '@atomic-testing/core';

export class SimpleButtonDriver extends ComponentDriver implements IClickableDriver {
  click(): Promise<void> {
    return this.interactor.click(this.locator);
  }

  get driverName(): string {
    return 'SimpleButtonDriver';
  }
}
```

## Why use drivers?

Drivers abstract away the DOM details of complex components. Instead of manipulating HTML in tests, you interact with high level methods (`next()`, `setValue()`, etc.). Drivers can expose child parts so you can compose them into larger units and reuse them across tests.

For example, the signup form in the example project is implemented with a `CredentialFormDriver` that wraps four MUI text fields and a navigation component. Tests only call `setValue()` and `next()` on this driver, keeping the assertions focused on behavior rather than DOM markup.

By composing multiple drivers you can model entire workflows with minimal test code.

### Composing drivers

The `LoginFormDriver` below demonstrates composing text field and button drivers to abstract the entire login form.

```ts title="LoginFormDriver.ts"
import { ButtonDriver, TextFieldDriver } from '@atomic-testing/component-driver-mui-v5';
import { ComponentDriver, Locator, Interactor, byDataTestId, ScenePart } from '@atomic-testing/core';

export const loginFormParts = {
  username: { locator: byDataTestId('username'), driver: TextFieldDriver },
  password: { locator: byDataTestId('password'), driver: TextFieldDriver },
  submit: { locator: byDataTestId('submit'), driver: ButtonDriver },
} satisfies ScenePart;

export class LoginFormDriver extends ComponentDriver<typeof loginFormParts> {
  constructor(locator: Locator, interactor: Interactor) {
    super(locator, interactor, { parts: loginFormParts });
  }

  async login(credentials: { username: string; password: string }): Promise<void> {
    await this.parts.username.setValue(credentials.username);
    await this.parts.password.setValue(credentials.password);
    await this.parts.submit.click();
  }

  get driverName(): string {
    return 'LoginFormDriver';
  }
}
```

This driver can itself be used as a part inside a larger `AuthenticatedAppDriver`, keeping individual tests concise.
