# Build Component Driver

Component drivers encapsulate the logic for interacting with a UI component. While many drivers are provided out of the box, you can build your own for custom widgets.

## Basic structure

A driver extends `ComponentDriver` and implements any interfaces that describe its capabilities. The `constructor` receives a locator, an interactor and optional configuration.

```ts title="SimpleButtonDriver.ts"
import { ComponentDriver, IClickableDriver } from '@atomic-testing/core';

export class SimpleButtonDriver extends ComponentDriver implements IClickableDriver {
  click(): Promise<void> {
    return this.interactor.click(this.locator);
  }

  get driverName(): string {
    return 'SimpleButtonDriver';
  }
}
```

## Why use drivers?

Drivers abstract away the DOM details of complex components. Instead of manipulating HTML in tests, you interact with high level methods (`next()`, `setValue()`, etc.). Drivers can expose child parts so you can compose them into larger units and reuse them across tests.

For example, the signup form in the example project is implemented with a `CredentialFormDriver` that wraps four MUI text fields and a navigation component. Tests only call `setValue()` and `next()` on this driver, keeping the assertions focused on behavior rather than DOM markup.

By composing multiple drivers you can model entire workflows with minimal test code.

## Example: composing a login form driver

The snippet below defines a `LoginFormDriver` that combines two `TextFieldDriver`s and a `ButtonDriver`. It exposes a high level `login()` helper so tests no longer deal with individual inputs.

<CodeBlock language='ts'>{loginFormDriver}</CodeBlock>

By wrapping the lower level drivers, the login test becomes very small:

```ts
await testEngine.parts.form.login({ username: 'alice', password: 's3cr3t' });
```

### Environment agnostic

Drivers rely on the `Interactor` abstraction, so the same driver can run in unit tests with JSDOM or in browser tests using Playwright or Cypress. Tests remain identical across environments.

:::tip Pro tip
Encapsulating interactions in drivers keeps tests declarative. When the login flow changes, update the driver once and reuse it for both unit and end‑to‑end scenarios.
