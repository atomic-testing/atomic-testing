# Interactor

An **Interactor** provides the low level operations used by component drivers to
manipulate and query the UI. Drivers delegate every action such as clicking,
entering text or reading an attribute to an interactor. By swapping the
interactor implementation, the same driver code works in different environments
like unit tests running in JSDOM or end‑to‑end tests with Playwright.

## Available interactors

The project ships with several interactors:

- **DOMInteractor** – runs against a DOM environment using
  `@testing-library` utilities. This is used for unit/integration tests.
- **ReactInteractor** and **@atomic-testing/react-19** – extensions of
  `DOMInteractor` that wrap interactions in `React`'s `act()` helper so state
  updates are flushed correctly when testing React 18 or 19 applications.
- **PlaywrightInteractor** – drives a Playwright `Page` object to execute tests
  in a real browser.

## Building an interactor

To build your own interactor, implement the `Interactor` interface from the core
package. Most custom interactors extend an existing one and override only the
behaviour that differs. The snippet below logs every click before delegating to
`DOMInteractor`:

<CodeBlock language='ts'>{loggingInteractor}</CodeBlock>

When creating a test engine, pass an instance of your custom interactor. Refer to
the implementation of `DOMInteractor` in
`packages/dom-core/src/DOMInteractor.ts` for a complete example.
