Use the Vue package to test Vue 3 components with Atomic Testing.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @atomic-testing/vue-3
```

The package handles Vue's reactivity and works with Single File Component style tests.

## Tips

- Wrap components with any providers you use, such as router or state managers.
- You can share scene definitions with React or Playwright tests.
