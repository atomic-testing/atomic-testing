This guide covers integrating **Atomic Testing** into a React project. It focuses on the packages you need and how they differ between React versions.

## Install the package

```bash
pnpm add @atomic-testing/react-18
```

Replace `react-18` with `react-19` or `react-legacy` if you use a different React version.

## Why multiple packages?

Each React package wraps the core APIs so they match the React runtime you are using. They expose the same `createTestEngine` function but ensure compatibility with your React version.

See the [Framework Guide](./framework-guide) for an overview of when to pick each package.
