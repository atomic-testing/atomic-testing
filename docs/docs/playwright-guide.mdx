Atomic Testing works with Playwright for full browser tests.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @atomic-testing/playwright
```

Create your scenes the same way as in React or Vue tests, then use `createTestEngine(page, scene)` to drive the browser.

Playwright lets you run the same drivers against real pages for end‑to‑end coverage.
