# Cheat Sheets

Most of the time, unit tests fail because the component
is not found or is rendered asynchronously. Incorrect
locators or hidden elements are common culprits. The
tips below help diagnose these issues.

### 1. Inspect component HTML

You may use `innerHTML()` to inspect the HTML of a component. This can be useful for debugging or troubleshooting.

Getting the HTML of a component can be useful to get a snapshot of the component's HTML structure and verify if it matches your expectations.
However it can be overwhelming to read the HTML, so use it wisely.

```ts
const html = await testEngine.parts.myComponent.innerHTML();
console.log(html);
```

### 2. Get component runtime CSS selector

You may use `runtimeCssSelector()` to get the runtime CSS selector of a component, and use it to query the DOM for the component in the browser,
this is especially useful when you have a Storybook story that renders the component, which allows you to inspect the component visually in the browser.

Use of `runtimeCssSelector()` is helpful to troubleshoot if the locator setting is correct.

```ts
const selector = await testEngine.parts.myComponent.runtimeCssSelector();
console.log(selector);

// You can use the selector to query the DOM for the component in the browser.
document.querySelector(selector);
```

### 3. Wait for the component to be visible

If your assertions run before the component finishes rendering,
use `waitUntilVisible()` to pause until the part is attached
and displayed.

```ts
await testEngine.parts.myComponent.waitUntilVisible();
```

### 4. Log DOM interactions

When troubleshooting complex behaviour, a custom interactor can
print every action for inspection.

```ts title="LoggingInteractor.ts"
import { ClickOption, PartLocator } from '@atomic-testing/core';
import { DOMInteractor } from '@atomic-testing/dom-core';

export class LoggingInteractor extends DOMInteractor {
  async click(locator: PartLocator, option?: Partial<ClickOption>): Promise<void> {
    console.log('clicking', await this.innerHTML(locator));
    await super.click(locator, option);
  }
}
```

Pass this interactor when creating the test engine so clicks are logged.

### 5. Clean up after each test

Always unmount the component to avoid crossâ€‘test contamination.

```ts
afterEach(async () => {
  await testEngine.cleanUp();
});
```
