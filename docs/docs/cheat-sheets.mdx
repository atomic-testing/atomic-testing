# Cheat Sheets & Troubleshooting

Most of the time, unit tests may fail because of an inco

### 1. Inspect component HTML

You may use `innerHTML()` to inspect the HTML of a component. This can be useful for debugging or troubleshooting.

Getting the HTML of a component can be useful to get a snapshot of the component's HTML structure and verify if it matches your expectations.
However it can be overwhelming to read the HTML, so use it wisely.

```ts
const html = await testEngine.parts.myComponent.innerHTML();
console.log(html);
```

### 2. Get component runtime CSS selector

You may use `runtimeCssSelector()` to get the runtime CSS selector of a component, and use it to query the DOM for the component in the browser,
this is especially useful when you have a Storybook story that renders the component, which allows you to inspect the component visually in the browser.

Use of `runtimeCssSelector()` is helpful to troubleshoot if the locator setting is correct.

```ts
const selector = await testEngine.parts.myComponent.runtimeCssSelector();
console.log(selector);

// You can use the selector to query the DOM for the component in the browser.
document.querySelector(selector);
```
