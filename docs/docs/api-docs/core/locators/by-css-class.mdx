Locate elements by their CSS class names.
Multiple classes can be provided and must all match.

Use this locator when your UI relies on semantic class names. Avoid targeting classes generated by CSS-in-JS libraries as they often change between builds.

```ts
const item = byCssClass('active-item');
```
