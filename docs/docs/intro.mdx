## The problem

Writing maintainable tests for your UI, built using popular third-party component libraries like Material UI or Bootstrap, can be challenging due to insufficient documentation on establishing communication between tests and these components.

Moreover, you want your tests to exclude intricate details about interacting with third-party components, enabling seamless test updates when the components change. This approach enhances the maintainability and adaptability of your test suite.

Furthermore, as your application scale, you also want a testing library that can scale with your application. You want to be able to compose reusable test strategies to test more complex components.

## The solution

Atomic Testing is designed to offer a consistent way to interact with third-party or first-party components across different testing environments, such as DOM testing or end-to-end testing.

The core principles of Atomic Testing are:

- **Reusability**: Deliver a standard and reusable method for interacting with components.
- **Composability**: Enable developers to compose reusable test strategies for testing more complex components.
- **Adaptability**: Ensure testing strategies can adapt to various test environments, including DOM testing (React, Angular, Vue) and end-to-end testing (Cypress, Playwright, Selenium/WebDriver).
