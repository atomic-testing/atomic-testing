# Core Concepts

Below are a few key concepts that you should be familiar with before you start using Atomic Testing.

## Component Driver

Component drivers are the core of Atomic Testing. They are responsible for describing how to interact with UI components programmatically, such as how to click on a button, select a value from a dropdown, or read a row from a grid.

There are growing number of component drivers available for popular UI frameworks such as Material UI, each component offers a set of methods that can be used to interact with the component. If TypeScript is used for writing tests,
auto-completion can be used to discover the available methods.

:::info
See [API Reference](./api.mdx#component-drivers) for a list of available component drivers.
:::

## Locator

Locators are used to find a component on the page. There are number of number of locator strategies available such as byDataTestId, byRole etc.

:::tip
Use of `data-testid` attribute is recommended for finding components on the page. See [Best Practices](./best-practices.mdx#data-testid) for more details. Use the `byDataTestId(value)` API to the recommended to build locators.

## ScenePart

ScenePart is a map that describes all the components of interest (part) in a scene (a page or a rich UI component). Each entry in a scene part describes the part name, the locator of the component and the component driver.

  <summary>A sample ScenePart of a typical login screen</summary>

```ts
import { ScenePart } from '@atomic-testing/core';
import { HTMLAnchorDriver, HTMLElementDriver } from '@atomic-testing/component-driver-html';
import { ButtonDriver, TextFieldDriver } from '@atomic-testing/component-driver-mui-v5';

const loginScenePart: ScenePart = {
  username: {
    locator: byDataTestId('username'),
    driver: TextFieldDriver,
  },
  password: {
    locator: byDataTestId('password'),
    driver: TextFieldDriver,
  },
  error: {
    locator: byDataTestId('error-display'),
    driver: HTMLElementDriver,
  },
  submit: {
    locator: byDataTestId('submit'),
    driver: ButtonDriver,
  },
  forgetPassword: {
    locator: byDataTestId('forget-password'),
    driver: HTMLAnchorDriver,
  },
} satisfies ScenePart;
```

</details>

## Test Engine

TestEngine is place where all the pieces come together. It is responsible for rendering a scene, finding all the components in the scene, and providing a set of methods to interact with the components.

Use `createTestEngine` to create an instance of TestEngine. `createTestEngine` function is specific for each rendering framework, such as React, Cypress and Playwright.

Below are examples of creating a Test Engine for the loginScenePart described above.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="react" label="React 18+">

```tsx
import { createTestEngine } from '@atomic-testing/react';
import { loginScenePart } from './loginScenePart';
import { Login } from './components/Login';

const testEngine = createTestEngine(<Login />, loginScenePart);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="react-legacy" label="React 17">

```tsx
import { createLegacyTestEngine } from '@atomic-testing/react/dist/createLegacyTestEngine';
import { loginScenePart } from './loginScenePart';
import { Login } from './components/Login';

const testEngine = createLegacyTestEngine(<Login />, loginScenePart);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="playwright" label="Playwright">

```tsx
import { createTestEngine } from '@atomic-testing/playwright';
import { loginScenePart } from './loginScenePart';

await page.goto('/login');
const testEngine = createTestEngine(page, loginScenePart);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cypress" label="Cypress">

```tsx
import { createTestEngine } from '@atomic-testing/cypress';
import { loginScenePart } from './loginScenePart';

cy.visit('/login');
const testEngine = createTestEngine(loginScenePart);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the test engine is created, it can be used to interact with the components in the scene.

```ts
// Test code is agnostic to the rendering framework

await testEngine.parts.username.setValue('john@example.com');
await testEngine.parts.password.setValue('');
await testEngine.parts.submit.click();

const error = await testEngine.parts.error.getText();
expect(error).toEqual('Password is required'); // Jest assertion, but any assertion library can be used
```
