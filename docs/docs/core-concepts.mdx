# Core Concepts

Before using Atomic Testing, familiarize yourself with the following key concepts:

## Component Driver

At the heart of Atomic Testing are component drivers. They define how to programmatically interact with UI components, such as clicking a button, selecting a value from a dropdown, or reading a row from a grid.

A growing number of component drivers are available for popular UI frameworks like [Material UI](https://mui.com). Each component driver offers a set of methods for interacting with the component. When using TypeScript for writing tests, auto-completion can help discover available methods.

:::info
Refer to the [API Reference](./api-overview.mdx#component-drivers) for a list of available component drivers.
:::

## Locator

Locators help find components on a page, using various [locator strategies](./api-overview.mdx#locator) such as `byDataTestId` and `byRole`.

:::tip
The use of the data-testid attribute is recommended for locating components on a page. Refer to [Best Practices](./best-practices.mdx#4-use-data-testid-for-key-elements) for more details. Use the `byDataTestId(value)` API as the recommended approach for building locators.

## ScenePart

A ScenePart is a map describing all components of interest (part) within a scene (a page or a rich UI component). Each entry in a ScenePart outlines the part name, the component locator, and the component driver.

  <summary>A sample ScenePart of a typical login screen</summary>
  <CodeBlock language='ts'>{loginScreenScenePart}</CodeBlock>
</details>

## Test Engine

The Test Engine is where all the pieces come together. It is responsible for rendering a scene, locating all the components in the scene, and providing a set of methods to interact with the components.

Use `createTestEngine` to create a Test Engine instance. The `createTestEngine` function is specific to each rendering framework, such as React, Vue, and Playwright.

The examples below demonstrate how to create a Test Engine for the loginScenePart described earlier.

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="react" label="React 18+">

```tsx
import { createTestEngine } from '@atomic-testing/react-18';

import { Login } from './components/Login';
import { loginScenePart } from './loginScenePart';

const testEngine = createTestEngine(<Login />, loginScenePart);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="react-legacy" label="React 16/17">

```tsx
import { createTestEngine } from '@atomic-testing/react-legacy';

import { Login } from './components/Login';
import { loginScenePart } from './loginScenePart';

const testEngine = createTestEngine(<Login />, loginScenePart);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="vue" label="Vue 3">

```ts
import { createTestEngine } from '@atomic-testing/vue-3';

import Login from './components/Login.vue';
import { loginScenePart } from './loginScenePart';

const testEngine = createTestEngine(Login, loginScenePart);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="playwright" label="Playwright">

```tsx
import { createTestEngine } from '@atomic-testing/playwright';

import { loginScenePart } from './loginScenePart';

await page.goto('/login');
const testEngine = createTestEngine(page, loginScenePart);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the test engine is created, it can be used to interact with the components in the scene.

```ts
// Test code is agnostic to the rendering framework

await testEngine.parts.username.setValue('john@example.com');
await testEngine.parts.password.setValue('');
await testEngine.parts.submit.click();

const error = await testEngine.parts.error.getText();
expect(error).toEqual('Password is required'); // Jest assertion, but any assertion library can be used
```
